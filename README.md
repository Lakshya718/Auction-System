## 🧑‍💻 Getting Started

### Clone the repo

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Lakshya718/Auction-Sytem.git
cd Auction-Sytem
```

Setup Frontend:

### How It Works:
- Players register them for upcoming auction.
- Team Owners can view and bid in real-time at auction date & time.
- Kafka handles bid updates and socket.io broadcasts them.
- When the auction ends, all players are assigned to their teams.
